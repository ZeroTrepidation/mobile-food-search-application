# mobile-food-search-application
A application that is built to facilitate search functionalities of various mobile food facilities. Currently limited to the scope of San Francisco


# Requirements

Search by name of applicant. Include optional filter on "Status" field.
Search by street name. The user should be able to type just part of the address. Example: Searching for "SAN" should return food trucks on "SANSOME ST"
Given a latitude and longitude, the API should return the 5 nearest food trucks. By default, this should only return food trucks with status "APPROVED", but the user should be able to override this and search for all statuses.
